## 📂 Repository Description

This repository contains **Turing Machine examples** developed during the  
**CENG 4005 – Formal Languages and Abstract Machines** course in class.

All projects were created as part of in-class exercises and assignments and focus
specifically on the **design and implementation of Turing Machines** for language
recognition and function computation.

The implementations are created using **JFLAP** and stored as `.jff` files.

---

## 🧠 Covered Concepts

The repository includes Turing Machine implementations for:

- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Function computation using Turing Machines
- Language recognition using single-tape and multi-tape Turing Machines
- Decision problems
- Comparison and conditional logic using Turing Machines

Some machines demonstrate complete solutions, while others are marked as **Not Completed**
to reflect their educational purpose.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **JFLAP** (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package)
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📁 File Information

- All files have the `.jff` extension (JFLAP format)
- File names describe the implemented function or language  
  Examples:
  - `X+YFunction.jff`
  - `X^2.jff`
  - `anbncnPushdownA.jff`
  - `ifXIsGreaterThanYreturn1elsereturn0.jff`

> ⚠️ Files must be opened using **JFLAP** to view or simulate the Turing Machines.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice Turing Machine design
- Apply theoretical concepts from Formal Languages
- Serve as a reference for Turing Machine examples
- Support learning and revision for the course
